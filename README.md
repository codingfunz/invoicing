# invoicing Script
A free stand-alone script to handle invoicing and payment via PayPal smart checkout.

## It is most basic
* The UI is not aesthectically dramatic, but can be formatted as desired
* The form fields has no labels, just placeholder attribute
* Data is saved as .json files
* Uses a simple login for administration. Can be developed for greater security if needed
* Form fields are **not sanitized**. Add security processes as needed
* If the MailJet SMTP tool will be used, the file named **vendor.zip** must be extracted to enable the dependent libraries
